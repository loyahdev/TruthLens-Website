TruthLens is an advanced tool designed to analyze text content and input with depth and a high accuracy. Built
with a custom-trained local model and accelerated by ChatGPT, it can detect and understand manipulative, misleading,
emotionally motivated, or harmful content while finding valuable patterns in the input. This then gets graphed on the website
for easy readable data and it gives you steps to truly understand articles or text without getting misinformed.

## README is to be completed.
